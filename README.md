## üîî Overview

This integration connects your WooCommerce store with MailPoet 2 so your customers can subscribe to your newsletters as they checkout with their purchase.


### üòÑ Is This Free?

Yes, it's free. But here's what you should _really_ care about:

* The code adheres to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) and follows best practices and conventions.


### ‚ùì What's the Catch?

This is a non-commercial plugin. As such:

* Support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

Please understand that this repository is not a place to seek help with configuration-related issues. Use it to report bugs.


## üçß Features and Benefits

* If you have more than one newsletter list, customers can select which list to subscribe when making a purchase.
* Double Opt-in.
* Decide if the checkbox/s to subscribe is checked or un-checked.
* Place the subscription fields on the checkout page where you want them to be.
* Custom checkbox label.


#### ‚úÖ Requirements

To use this extension you will need:

* PHP v5.6+
* WordPress v4.7+
* [WooCommerce v3.X+](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)
* [MailPoet 2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wysija-newsletters/)


#### üíΩ Installation

1. Download a `.zip` file with the [latest version](https://github.com/seb86/MailPoet-WooCommerce-Add-on/releases).
2. Go to **WordPress Admin > Plugins > Add New**.
3. Click **Upload Plugin** at the top.
4. **Choose File** and select the `.zip` file you downloaded in **Step 1**.
5. Click **Install Now** and **Activate** the extension.


### üíú Usage

To setup this plugin, go to **WooCommerce -> Settings** and then the MailPoet tab. The settings are in two sections. `General | Available Lists`

**General** contains the main settings for the plugin.

**Available Lists** contains a table listing of all your created lists. Select the lists you want your customers to subscribe to by ticking the checkbox next to the list and press **Save changes**.

That's it, now when your customers tick the subscribe checkbox on the checkout page, they will be subscribed to the newsletter/s you selected when processing an order.

## ‚ùî Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1. Can I place the subscription field anywhere?**
